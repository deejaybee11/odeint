Another ODE solver written in Rust. While there are plenty of ODE solvers out there, this one is mine, and also I mostly wanted something that was easy to tune as needed, able to perform single steps without running the full solver, and was compatible with my other projects. It has a basic example for exponential decay to demonstrate it, but it works with any ARC you could choose. 

This has not been tested for edge cases, nor yet optimized to high heavens so take it with a grain of salt if you happen to stumble across this glorious piece of garbage.
